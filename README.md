✅ **Next Step:**  
- Create a new file: `README.md` in the root of your project.  
- Paste this content into it.  
- Commit to GitHub as:
  ```
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "Add initial project README"
  git push origin main
  ```

Would you like me to prepare other starter files as well (like `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, or basic `Dockerfile` templates)?
